Separated interleaved example
=============================

Introduction
------------

This example is taken from Listing S5 in the 2013 JBNMR nmrglue paper.  In
this example a pseudo-3D NMRPipe data set is separated into 2D data sets using
the script `seperate.py`.


Instructions
------------

Execute `python seperate.py` to separate the pseudo-3D data set into 2D data
sets.  Six directories with names `techo_XXXX.fid` will be created.
