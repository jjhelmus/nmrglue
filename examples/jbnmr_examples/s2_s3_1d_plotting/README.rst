1D visualization examples
=========================

Introduction
------------

These two examples are taken from Listing S2 and S3 in the 2013 JBNMR nmrglue
paper.  In the first example a the 1D time domain signal from a NMRPipe file
(`test.fid`) is visualized using the `plot_1d_pipe_time.py` script.  In the
second example a portion of a 1D 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum is visualized from
the NMRPipe file `test.ft` using the script `plot_1d_pipe_freq.py`


Instructions
------------

Execute `python plot_1d_pipe_time.py` to visualize the data in the file
`test.fid`.  The resulting file `fid.png` is presented as Figure 2 in the
paper.

Execute `python plot_1d_pipe_spectrum.py` to visualize the data in the file
`test.ft`.  The resulting file `spectrum.png` is presented as Figure 3 in the
paper.
