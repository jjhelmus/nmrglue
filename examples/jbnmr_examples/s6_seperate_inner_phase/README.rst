Separated inner phase example
=============================

Introduction
------------

This example is taken from Listing S6 in the 2013 JBNMR nmrglue paper.  In
this example a pseudo-3D NMRPipe data set is separated into 2D data sets using
the script `seperate.py` where there is an innermost quadrature phase loop. 


Instructions
------------

Execute `python seperate.py` to separate the pseudo-3D data set into 2D data
sets.  Ten directories with names `nredor_XX.fid` will be created.
