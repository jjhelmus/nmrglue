2D visualization example
========================

Introduction
------------

This example is taken from Listing S4 from the 2013 JBNMR nmrglue paper.  In
this example a 2D SSNMR spectrum is visualized using the script
`plot_2d_pipe_spectrum.py`


Instructions
------------

Execute `python plot_2d_pipe_spectrum.py` to visualize the data in the file
`test.ft`.  The resulting file `spectrum_2d.png` is presented as Figure 4 in
the paper.
