To Do and other updates
=======================

Idea list broken down by directory.

global
------
-Use CapCase for classes

nmrglue
-------

    filio
    -----
    - lowmemory (in-place) writing of regions of data.
        Use data_nd functionality with put_slice.
    - ability to write slices to file in all modules (ala pipe.write_slice3d)
    - global iter3D object
    - update simpson module with write functions
    - update glue module?
    - sparky_nd object? or dimension agnostic functions?
    - spinev module?

    gui? 
    ----
    - gui module with common gui functions?
    - Sounds like a good idea

    process
    ------
    - test and document proc_lp module and lp/lpc/lp2d in pipe_proc module.
    - glue_proc module?
    - debug XXX in pipe_proc
    - more work on broken tests in test_pipe_proc
    - proc_mem module (Maximum Entropy)?
    - add missing functions in pipe_proc
    - FWHT in proc_base
    - profile processing and optimize
    - poly_td and poly_fd in proc_bl.py

test
----

-   The following modules do not have tests, decide how to test them and where
    such tests belong:

Module          Notes
------          ------
fileiobase      Tested
glue            Not currently imported
table
proc_base       Partially tested with pipe_proc test
proc_bl         Partially tested with pipe_proc test
proc_lp         Partially tested with pipe_proc test
analysisbase    No tests needed
helpers
leastsqbound
lineshapes1d
linesh
peakpick
segmentation
misc

- Check coverage on current tests, get to 80%+
- Create unit tests?


doc
---

-   Rewrite tutorial including a mention of analysis modules.
-   pipe_proc: Add References to low level function / better description
-   proc_base : Additional documentation, indication which functions work on
    arbitrary dimensional data.
-   proc_bl : Flesh out the sol_* functions?
-   helpers : Better documentation, examples?
-   lineshapes1d : add .. math:: in lineshape documentation?
-   peakpick : Add links to the picking algorithms.
-   segmentation : Add See Also sections?

Other thoughts
--------------
- Unix like commands (coadd_pipe, seperate_varian, ...)
- GUI to create conversions scripts
