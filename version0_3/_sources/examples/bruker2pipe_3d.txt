convert example: bruker2pipe_3d
===============================

This example shows how to use nmrglue to convert between the Bruker and NMRPipe
file format for a 3D data set.  The last block of code lists the differences
between this conversion and one performed with bruk2pipe. Note that the
direct dimension digital filter is not removed in either conversion.
